A simple but self-contained example of a PyTorch extension that implements both CPU as well as CUDA code for LLTM.
It dynamically selects between CPU or CUDA execution.

Based on official example code from following repositories:
- [https://github.com/pytorch/extension-cpp](https://github.com/pytorch/extension-cpp)
- [https://github.com/Project-MONAI/MONAI/tree/dev/monai/csrc/lltm](https://github.com/Project-MONAI/MONAI/tree/dev/monai/csrc/lltm)
